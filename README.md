## User Stories

- As a job-seeker, I am especially conscious of my tone in communication with potential employers. I want to make sure I'm coming off professionally and upbeat and I want to run my emails through a screening process before I send them. 

- As a single person who just signed up for a dating app, I want to see how my profile is perceived by potential matches. Am I coming off too serious or too playful? I would like some feedback on how to make my profile more appealing.

- As a recruiter, I have to send a lot of rejection emails to candidates who were not the right fit for the role. It's a sensitive email to send and I want to perfect my template to sound compassionate and try to make sure they still have a positive impression of the company. I'd like to be able to save a few different templates to my account after I get the language right.

- As a small business owner, I don't have much time to write the perfect rejection email for job candidates and I'd like some ideas from more experienced HR professionals. I want to browse through saved emails that scored well on the tone analyzer.

- As a student who is not great at spelling and working with others, I want to run my emails through a grammar check to make sure I wrote everything correctly, and to make sure I have a good attitude when writing to my fellow students for group projects. 


## Conflict Plan
We will all try to be open and honest in our communication at all times but especially if a conflict does arise. Although it can be awkward, we all agree that raising problems is the best way to work through them. We'll give each person the opportunity to speak during discussions since several of us are quiet. 

## Communication Plan
We will check in as a team every two hours to see how everyone is feeling, if they have enough/too much work, and use it as a chance to bring up any potential issues.
