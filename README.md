### Project Description 
Leveraging the IBM Watson Tone Analyzer API, we'll provide users an empty slate to paste text, and in turn, give them analysis of that text. The page will require user login and authentication, have a page for user text insertion, showcase the user's historical submission history, and all users submission history.

In order to create this app, we'll need to install the IBM Watson Tone Analyzer NodeJS package. Different from other APIs, this will require the API call from the back-end, as opposed to the front-end. 

### Problem Domain
Communication is difficult. Sometimes we don't come across the way we intend, so developing a tool that leverages a tone analyzer API can assist individuals in checking their tone. By measuring anger, fear, joy, sadness, analytical, confident, and tentative tones, user can adjust their message to best fit their goals for communication. 

### Developer Instructions
To get this application up and running on your own machine, download the repository from GitHub, run the NPM install to get all dependencies in the package.json file, and set up a .env file with your own IBM Watson Tone Analyzer API key.

## User Stories

- As a job-seeker, I am especially conscious of my tone in communication with potential employers. I want to make sure I'm coming off professionally and upbeat and I want to run my emails through a screening process before I send them. 

- As a single person who just signed up for a dating app, I want to see how my profile is perceived by potential matches. Am I coming off too serious or too playful? I would like some feedback on how to make my profile more appealing.

- As a recruiter, I have to send a lot of rejection emails to candidates who were not the right fit for the role. It's a sensitive email to send and I want to perfect my template to sound compassionate and try to make sure they still have a positive impression of the company. I'd like to be able to save a few different templates to my account after I get the language right.

- As a small business owner, I don't have much time to write the perfect rejection email for job candidates and I'd like some ideas from more experienced HR professionals. I want to browse through saved emails that scored well on the tone analyzer.

- As a student who is not great at spelling and working with others, I want to run my emails through a grammar check to make sure I wrote everything correctly, and to make sure I have a good attitude when writing to my fellow students for group projects.
